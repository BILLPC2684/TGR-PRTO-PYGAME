## NOTE: if the emulator errors, crashes or glitch out, check your ROM before reporting(if someone else made the ROM then contact them)

# Why does GitHub updates take so long?
 - i myself(BILLPC2684) is mostly the only one working on this project, so it's a slow process
 - life issues and school blocking from getting work done(plus not to mention other projects)
## PLEASE BE PATIENT... Updates will come ASAP on schedule(hopefully)

# Are ROMs free?
Yes for the most part, now people can charge or setup a donation system for their ROMs
## We have no responsibility if your ROM gets hacked/modded or republished without your permission

# Building the Emulator
 - Theres no Building needed!
 - Have `Python3.8` and `PyGame`[via PIP] installed!
 - Run [`TGR.py`](./TGR.py) with `python3.8` and thats it! ![alt text](./bin/TGR_logo.png)
